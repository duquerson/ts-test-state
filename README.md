# Testing State Quiz Project

## What the Project Does

This project is a quiz application built to demonstrate state management using Zustand, fetching data, and implementing a user interface with Astro and React. It presents users with a series of questions and allows them to select answers, providing feedback on their choices.

## How to Install

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd testing-state
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Potential Improvements

*   Implement more robust error handling and display user-friendly error messages.
*   Add a feature to track user scores and provide a summary at the end of the quiz.
*   Implement a timer for each question or the entire quiz.
*   Fetch quiz data from a remote API instead of a local JSON file.
*   Add different question types (e.g., multiple-choice with multiple correct answers, true/false).
*   Improve the user interface with more advanced styling and animations.
*   Add unit tests for components, state management, and utility functions.
